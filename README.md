# Underwater Plastic Detection
## Overview
With a rise in the manufacturing and consumption of plastic products, plastic pollution in oceans poses a major threat to marine life and global sustainability. 
This project explores two computer vision approaches to identify plastic underwater using a publicly available dataset from Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/arnavs19/underwater-plastic-pollution-detection) <br><br>
Approaches explored are:<br>
1. **Image Classification** — determines whether plastic objects are present in an underwater image<br>
2. **Object Detection** — locates different types of plastic debris within the image
